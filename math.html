But, financial issues forced hi to drop out, he dropped out of college and continued to study mathematics. In 1913, Ramanujan sent his mathematical discoveries to a mathematician in Cambridge G.H. Hardy, who recognized his knoledge and invited him to Cambridge. Ramanujan's time at Cambridge was marked by significant contributions to mathematics.
